# Functional Programming

## Introduction
Functional programming is a programming paradigm that treats computation as 
the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing state and mutable data.

## Key Concepts

### 1. Pure Functions
- Functions that always produce the same output for the same input
- No side effects
- Example:
```ocaml
let add x y = x + y  (* Pure function *)
```

### 2. Immutability
- Data cannot be changed once created
- Instead of modifying data, create new data structures
- Helps prevent bugs and makes code easier to reason about

### 3. First-Class Functions
- Functions can be:
  - Assigned to variables
  - Passed as arguments
  - Returned from other functions
```ocaml
let apply f x = f x  (* Function as parameter *)
```

### 4. Higher-Order Functions
- Functions that take other functions as arguments
- Common examples:
  - map
  - filter
  - reduce
```ocaml
let numbers = [1; 2; 3; 4; 5]
let doubled = List.map (fun x -> x * 2) numbers
```

### 5. Recursion
- Primary looping construct in functional programming
- Example:
```ocaml
let rec factorial n =
  match n with
  | 0 -> 1
  | n -> n * factorial (n-1)
```

## Benefits of Functional Programming

1. **Predictability**
   - Easier to test and debug
   - No side effects
   - Deterministic outcomes

2. **Concurrency**
   - Immutable data prevents race conditions
   - Easier to implement parallel operations

3. **Modularity**
   - Functions are independent units
   - Easy to compose and reuse

## Common Functional Programming Patterns

### Pattern Matching
```ocaml
type shape =
  | Circle of float
  | Rectangle of float * float

let area = function
  | Circle r -> 3.14 *. r *. r
  | Rectangle (w, h) -> w *. h
```

### Option Types
- Handle absence of values safely
```ocaml
type 'a option = None | Some of 'a
```

### Function Composition
- Building complex functions from simple ones
```ocaml
let compose f g x = f (g x)
```

## Best Practices

1. Always favor immutability
2. Write pure functions when possible
3. Use pattern matching over conditional statements
4. Leverage the type system
5. Think recursively
