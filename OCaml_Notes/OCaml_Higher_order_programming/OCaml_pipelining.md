Here's a **concise and complete note** for **Section 4.6: Pipelining** from your OCaml material:

## 📘 4.6 Pipelining — Summary Notes

---

### ✅ **Goal**

Demonstrate a **clear and functional programming style** using the **pipeline operator `|>`** to process data through a sequence of transformations.

---

### 🧮 Example: Sum of Squares from 0 to `n`

#### ✅ Efficient Math Formula (best performance):

$$
\text{sum\_sq}(n) = \frac{n(n+1)(2n+1)}{6}
$$

#### 🚫 Assume we **forgot** the formula.

---

### 🆚 **Imperative Approach (Python)**

```python
def sum_sq(n):
    sum = 0
    for i in range(0, n+1):
        sum += i * i
    return sum
```

---

### 🌀 **Tail-Recursive OCaml Version**

```ocaml
let sum_sq n =
  let rec loop i sum =
    if i > n then sum
    else loop (i + 1) (sum + i * i)
  in loop 0 0
```

✅ **Efficient**: Constant space and time-efficient recursion
❌ **Less declarative/functional in style**

---

### 🔗 **Functional Pipelined Version**

```ocaml
let rec ( -- ) i j = if i > j then [] else i :: i + 1 -- j
let square x = x * x
let sum = List.fold_left ( + ) 0

let sum_sq n =
  0 -- n
  |> List.map square
  |> sum
```

🔍 What’s happening:

1. `0 -- n`: Builds list `[0; 1; 2; ...; n]`
2. `List.map square`: Squares each element
3. `sum`: Adds all the squares

✅ **Readable** and **declarative**
❌ **Inefficient** — creates intermediate lists (space: O(n))

---

### 🆚 Other Less Clear Versions

```ocaml
(* Verbose with unnecessary let-bindings *)
let sum_sq n =
  let l = 0 -- n in
  let sq_l = List.map square l in
  sum sq_l

(* Nested calls — hard to read *)
let sum_sq n =
  sum (List.map square (0 -- n))
```

---

### 🚀 About the Pipeline Operator `|>`

* **Definition**: `x |> f` is the same as `f x`
* Promotes **top-to-bottom** and **left-to-right** reading
* Encourages writing code as a **pipeline of transformations**
* Used heavily in OCaml **module-based APIs** and in libraries like `Core`, `Base`, etc.

---

### ⚠️ Efficiency Caveat

* ❌ The pipeline version builds **intermediate lists**, increasing space and runtime
* ✅ The tail-recursive version avoids those by computing directly

> **Important:** The **inefficiency is not caused by `|>`** itself — but by building full intermediate lists.

---

### ✅ Takeaway

| Style               | Readability | Space Efficiency | Time Efficiency |
| ------------------- | ----------- | ---------------- | --------------- |
| Tail-recursion      | Low         | ✅ Constant       | ✅ Efficient     |
| Pipeline functional | ✅ High      | ❌ Linear         | ❌ Slower        |

💡 Use pipelining for **clarity** and **expressiveness**, but **optimize** when performance is critical.
